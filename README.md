# CS19 in collaboration with CENSIS

University project completed as of March 2021

## Face mask detection system with fever checking  

This project is designed to help with workplace/public safety in response to COVID-19.  

We aim to ease the issue of non-compliance/forgetfulness with mask wearing before 
entering buildings by prompting users to wear a mask based on our face 
mask detection model.  

We have automated the process of temperature measurement; no human intervention 
is required. If the user has a temperature greater than 38Â°C the user is alerted 
of their elevated temperature and directed to not enter the building.  

Part of the project aim was to allow future development/expansion of our model by 
providing scripts to create artificial dataset images (face masks overlaid on the 
user's choice of images) and making it easy for users to train a model using our 
algorithm, this process is described in detail within the documentation.  

## Usage

Instructions on how to use each part of this project is described in the documentation.

The above directory contains our artificial face mask overlay scripts.  
These are designed to be used in the creation of a dataset for training a face
mask detection model.
